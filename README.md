When writing this, I was not aware that there was already a programming language called "PowerHouse" exactly written the same...

Thats why I added a - they are technically different so I guess that's all.

"Definition of powerhouse  1a : power plant sense 1 b : a source of influence or inspiration 2 : one having great power: such as a : one having great drive, energy,

or ability a powerhouse rock band b : an athletic team characterized by strong aggressive play"

PowerHouse aims to influence and/or inspire people, etc.

PowerHouse aims to be a powerful programming language.

PowerHouse aims to have good abilitys (advantages)

PowerHouse is strongly-typed. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/430182/is-c-strongly-typed)

It's suprising the defintion fits with the programming language :)

The PowerHouse programming is good with handling big things.

It handles data well.

It can make big applications.
# Why was this made?
As an alternative to C++

Also a mix of C++, Rust, C and Python because those 4 programming languages are good at making many programs and have weaknesses and advantages, mixing them together

would make a programming language that is very nice.

PowerHouse aims to be fast like c++.

PowerHouse also aims to be memory safe like Rust.

I admire rust honestly.

PowerHouse aims to be productive like Rust.

PowerHouse aims to be easy like Python.

PowerHouse aims to have a scrict compiler like Rust.

PowerHouse aims to have a IDE for itself like Python.

# What it should be used in
Desktop Applications

Operating Systems

Back end

Embedded

Hacking

Game Development

Data Science

Machine Learning

Hardware
# What it aims to do
# Be safe (memory safe, etc):
INSPIRED BY: Rust

PowerHouse aims to be momory safe, this helps developers feel more confident with code and the code will have less bugs.

Less bugs are very important.
# Be fast
INSPIRED BY: Rust, C, C++

PowerHouse aims to be fast, this means that it can run well on older machines.

PowerHouse also helps the program run fast, this leads to better apps, games etc.
# Be productive
PowerHouse aims to be productive, this means that there will be more developer productivity and better apps, games, etc.

More productivity also means that the program will be built faster, while still being built well.
# Be easy (in a way)
INSPIRED BY: Python

It most likely won't be easy, but it aims to be easier than languages like c++

PowerHouse want's to make it easy for people to learn and use it.
# Have a good compiler
INSPIRED BY: Rust

PowerHouse aims to have a compiler that is:
# Scrict
A scrict compiler helps developers eliminate bugs quickly and easily.
# Helpful
PowerHouse's compiler will help the developer be more productive by giving useful error help, when the compiler detects a error, the compiler will give a error 

number, the number could be found in PowerHouse's website and the number gives a good explanation.
# PowerHouse IDE
When you install PowerHouse, there will be an IDE with it, the IDE aims to be:
# Helpful
Gives suggestions on what you should write next.

Gives a definition of the command you wrote.

Debugs correctly and quickly, outlining the mistakes and telling you how you can fix them.

Compiles and runs quickly.

Opensource of course, you can edit it and help PowerHouse.

Fixes wrong spelling.
# PowerHouse community
PowerHouse aims to have a:

Helpful community,

A nice community,

A innovated community,

etc

The PowerHouse community will let you ask things and let you answer questions.
# Learn PowerHouse
PowerHouse will have a book, an online course and a documentation.
# Help
You can help the PowerHouse project, you just add on to the code and I can merge it (if it should be)
